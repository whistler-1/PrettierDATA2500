### Project closed
Original goal: Making a browser extension to improve the looks of https://os.cs.oslomet.no/os/

I stopped working on this project, as it ceased to be neccesary. At the time, 
the website that hosted course material for my operating systems class was sorely 
lacking in any styling, and lacked any responsive design, so I wrote some custom CSS.

I changed the font for p tags to Literata, designed for ebooks it suited the site's
long explanatory paragraphs and assignment texts. I changed the font used for code to 
JetBrains Mono, a clear and readable code font. 

I added margins, making everything more readable and feeling less cramped, and ensured
that those margins would be adjusted according to the screen used. I changed the max
width for images, so they didn't go off the screen on mobile. 

And so I started this project, intending to publish a browser extension that one could 
install that simply added my custom CSS to that site. While working on this in a lab, 
the professor saw my work and asked me to email him the css file. After one small tweak, 
he added my styling to his site and that was that. I'll probably find some other excuse
to make a browser extension some day, but for now I have other things to do.
